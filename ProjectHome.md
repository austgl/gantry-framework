Gantry is a comprehensive set of building blocks to enable
the rapid development and realization of a design into a flexible
and powerful web platform theme. Currently Gantry is available for Joomla, but other platforms will follow.

Please see the [Gantry Framework](http://www.gantry-framework.org/) website for more info.
